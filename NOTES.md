# Docker Notes


### What is Containerization ?

Containerization is a technology that allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged into self-contained units called containers. Each container provides a lightweight and isolated runtime environment that includes everything needed to run the application, such as the application code, libraries, and system tools.

Containers use operating system-level virtualization to provide this isolation, which allows multiple containers to run on the same host system without interfering with each other. This approach differs from traditional virtualization, where each virtual machine runs a separate copy of the operating system and consumes more resources.

Containerization provides several benefits over traditional approaches to application deployment. First, it simplifies the process of deploying and running applications, as all the required dependencies are packaged together in a single container image. This can save time and reduce the risk of configuration errors.

Second, containers are highly portable, as they can be easily moved between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without modification. This can simplify the process of deploying applications across multiple platforms.

Finally, containers offer increased scalability and resource utilization, as they can be easily deployed and managed in a distributed environment, such as a cloud-based infrastructure. This can help organizations to better optimize their resources and reduce costs.

### What is Docker ?

Docker is a popular platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications in a containerized environment. It allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into containers, which are self-contained and isolated from the host system and other containers.

Docker uses a client-server architecture, where the Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which is responsible for building, running, and managing containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same machine or on different machines, and communicate using REST API calls.

Docker containers are based on Docker images, which are essentially snapshots of an application and its dependencies at a given point in time. Docker images can be built manually or automatically using Dockerfiles, which are scripts that specify the steps needed to build an image.

With Docker, developers can easily create, deploy, and scale their applications across different environments, including on-premise servers, public clouds, and hybrid cloud environments. Docker also offers a rich ecosystem of tools and services, including Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes, that can be used to orchestrate and manage containers at scale.

## <u>Virtualization vs Docker</u>

## <u>Advantages of Docker</u>

- Caching a cluster of containers
- Flexible resource sharing
- Scalability - many containers can be placed in a single host
- Running your service on hardware that is much cheaper than standard servers
- Fast deployment, ease of creating new instances, and faster migrations.
- Ease of moving and maintaining your applications
- Better security, less access needed to work with the code running - - - inside containers, and fewer software dependencies

### <u>[Basic Docker Commands](COMMANDS.md)</u>


## <u>Dockerfile</u>

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile.

Format
Here is the format of the Dockerfile:


> `# Comment`
<br>
> INSTRUCTION arguments

The instruction is not case-sensitive. However, convention is for them to be UPPERCASE to distinguish them from arguments more easily.

Docker runs instructions in a Dockerfile in order. A Dockerfile must begin with a FROM instruction. This may be after parser directives, comments, and globally scoped ARGs. The FROM instruction specifies the Parent Image from which you are building. FROM may only be preceded by one or more ARG instructions, which declare arguments that are used in FROM lines in the Dockerfile.

Docker treats lines that begin with # as a comment, unless the line is a valid parser directive. A # marker anywhere else in a line is treated as an argument. This allows statements like:


> ` Comment`
<br>
> RUN echo 'we are running some # of cool things'

Comment lines are removed before the Dockerfile instructions are executed, which means that the comment in the following example is not handled by the shell executing the echo command, and both examples below are equivalent:

```sh
RUN echo hello \
# comment
world
```

```sh
RUN echo hello \
world
```
### Some Dockerfile Instructions
---
#### FROM
>The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions. As such, a valid Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction. The image can be any valid image â€“ it is especially easy to start by pulling an image from the Public Repositories.

#### RUN
>RUN has 2 forms:
>* RUN <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c on Linux or cmd /S /C on Windows)
>* RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)
<br>
>The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.
