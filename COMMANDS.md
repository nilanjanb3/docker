# *Top Docker Commands*

Sl No| Commands | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
|1| `$ docker run nginx`| If you don't have the Nginx Docker image locally, Docker will download it from Docker Hub, which is the default public registry for Docker images. Docker will then start a container based on the Nginx image, using the default settings. This will launch the Nginx web server and expose it on port 80.|
|2| `$ docker ps` | The docker ps command is used to list all the running containers on a Docker host. It provides information such as the container ID, image used to create the container, command being run in the container, container status, ports being exposed, and the name of the container.|
|3| $` docker ps -a` | The docker ps -a command is used to list all the containers on a Docker host, including running and stopped containers. It provides similar information to docker ps, such as container ID, image used to create the container, command being run in the container, container status, ports being exposed, and the name of the container.|
