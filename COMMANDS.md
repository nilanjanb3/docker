## Docker Commands
---

```sh
$ docker run nginx
```
The command "docker run nginx" is used to run a Docker container with the Nginx web server.

Here's what happens when you execute this command:

If you don't have the Nginx Docker image locally, Docker will download it from Docker Hub, which is the default public registry for Docker images.

Docker will then start a container based on the Nginx image, using the default settings. This will launch the Nginx web server and expose it on port 80.

Once the container is running, you can access the Nginx web server by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost.

If you want to stop the container, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal or execute the "docker stop" command followed by the container ID or name. For example, "docker stop my-nginx-container".

```sh
$ docker ps
```

```sh
$ docker ps -a
```

```sh
$ docker stop <container id/name>
```

```sh
$ docker rm <container id/name>
```

```sh
$ docker images
```

```sh
$ docker rmi <image name>
```

```sh
$ docker pull <image name>
